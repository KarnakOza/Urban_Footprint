# What is Urban Footprints ?

It is Spatial extent of urbanized areas, areas dominated by buildings, street and impervious surfaces which are man-made structures.
Natural surfaces within cities are not to be taken into account.

Further possible will be on Multitemporal settlemets masks enable quantification of urban growth/shrinkage.

In terms of Demands:
Often rapid(uncontrolled) growth of cities espicially in Industrialized countries.

Demands for Urban Footprint Mapping
Urban footprints reuired for regional-scale planning and global spatial distritbution of urban areas as key elements of sustainable development

# Characteristics of Urban Footprint

High Backscatter: Predominance of single and double bounce,
High Phase stability of anthropogenic structures between SAR images,
Orientation of buildings to azimuth angle affects backscatter.

Heterogeneity and texture can be used to map urban footprint.

# ***Change Detection Analysis***

- In Order to detect changed Urban areas following things should be considered:
- Spatial Scale should be large enough to detect the changed areas, i.e. spatial resolution higher than changed areas.
  [For Sentinel-1 SLC only applicable at block level and not at single house level.
- Temporal Scale: Time difference between two urban masks, works for several years or for different days but should be of same level either Asecending or Descending orbits.
