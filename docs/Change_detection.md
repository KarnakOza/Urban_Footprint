***Alteration in the surface components of the vegetation cover***
***Spectral/Spatial movements of a vegetation entity over time***

- Changes of land cover(LC) entity can:
- Become a different LC class
- Expand, shrink or alter shape
- shift position
- fragment or coalesce.


## Types of changes
- Short term changes (synoptic weather events)
- cyclic change (seasonal change)
- directional change (urban development)
- multidirectional  change (deforestation & regeneration)
- event change (catastropic fires)


## CHANGE VECTOR ANALYSIS
**Capability to analyse change concurrently in all data layers**
*Requires accurate rad. Calibration*
*Requires exact thresold definition*

-Multidimensional extension of the image differencing technique.

-difference between radiometric values for multiple bands.

-change differences exhibiting vectors (direction) and magnitudes (intensity).
